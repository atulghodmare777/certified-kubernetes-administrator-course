# Static Pods 
  - Take me to [Video Tutorial](https://kodekloud.com/topic/static-pods/)
  
In this section, we will take a look at Static Pods

#### How do you provide a pod definition file to the kubelet without a kube-apiserver?
- You can configure the kubelet to read the pod definition files from a directory on the server designated to store information about pods.

## Configure Static Pod
- The designated directory can be any directory on the host and the location of that directory is passed in to the kubelet as an option while running the service.
  - The option is named as **`--pod-manifest-path`**.

## Another way to configure static pod 
- Instead of specifying the option directly in the **`kubelet.service`** file, you could provide a path to another config file using the config option, and define the directory path as staticPodPath in the file.

#### The kubelet can create both kinds of pods - the static pods and the ones from the api server at the same time.

## Following is 1 imp question, suppose we have following task how to do it:
We just created a new static pod named static-greenbox. Find it and delete it.
First, let's identify the node in which the pod called static-greenbox is created. To do this, run:
root@controlplane:~# kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide  | grep static-greenbox
default       static-greenbox-node01                 1/1     Running   0          19s     10.244.1.2   node01       <none>           <none>
root@controlplane:~#
From the result of this command, we can see that the pod is running on node01.


Next, SSH to node01 and identify the path configured for static pods in this node.

Important: The path need not be /etc/kubernetes/manifests. Make sure to check the path configured in the kubelet configuration file.
root@controlplane:~# ssh node01 
root@node01:~# ps -ef |  grep /usr/bin/kubelet 
root        4147       1  0 14:05 ?        00:00:00 /usr/bin/kubelet --bootstrap-kubeconfig=/etc/kubernetes/bootstrap-kubelet.conf --kubeconfig=/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf --config=/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml --container-runtime-endpoint=unix:///var/run/containerd/containerd.sock --pod-infra-container-image=registry.k8s.io/pause:3.9
root        4773    4733  0 14:05 pts/0    00:00:00 grep /usr/bin/kubelet

root@node01:~# grep -i staticpod /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml
staticPodPath: /etc/just-to-mess-with-you

root@node01:~# 
Here the staticPodPath is /etc/just-to-mess-with-you


Navigate to this directory and delete the YAML file:
root@node01:/etc/just-to-mess-with-you# ls
greenbox.yaml
root@node01:/etc/just-to-mess-with-you# rm -rf greenbox.yaml 
root@node01:/etc/just-to-mess-with-you#
wait for 30 seconds.

Exit out of node01 using CTRL + D or type exit. You should return to the controlplane node, Check if the static-greenbox pod has been deleted:
root@controlplane:~# kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide  | grep static-greenbox
root@controlplane:~#
